# Quick reference

Screen key-binding:

        Ctrl-a

Detach a screen session:

        Ctrl-a d

Reattach a screen session:

        screen -r [session]

Reattach an attached (multi-user) screen session:

        screen -r user[/session]

To enter a screen command:

        Ctrl-a :

Example:

        Ctrl-a :sessionname testname

# Multi-user screen

Screen needs to be run as setuid root to be able to share
screens between different users. On Debian, screen is not
setup like that by default, chmod u+x screen to 'fix' this,
and revert afterwards.

An example where user 'martijn' creates a screen session with name 'testsession'
to which user 'thomas' can attach read-only:

        $ screen -S testsession
        Ctrl-a :multiuser on
        Ctrl-a :writelock on
        Ctrl-a :acladd otheruser

User 'thomas' can now:

        $ screen -x martijn/testsession
