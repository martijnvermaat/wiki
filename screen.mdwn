# Multi-user screen

Screen needs to be run as setuid root to be able to share
screens between different users. On Debian, screen is not
setup like that by default, chmod u+x screen to 'fix' this,
and revert afterwards.

An example where user 'martijn' creates a screen session with name 'testsession'
to which user 'thomas' can attach read-only:

    $ screen -S testsession
    Ctrl-a :multiuser on
    Ctrl-a :writelock on
    Ctrl-a :acladd otheruser

User 'thomas' can now:

    $ screen -x martijn/testsession
