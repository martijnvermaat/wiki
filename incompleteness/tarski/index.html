<p>Incompleteness proof based on truth sets.</p>

<p>Popular version of Tarski's Theorem:</p>

<blockquote><p>Truth (within the system) is not definable (within the system) (for systems of sufficient strength)</p></blockquote>

<p>Precise version:</p>

<p>For any language L, if</p>

<ul>
<li>for any set A expressible in L, the set A* is expressible in L, and</li>
<li>for any set A expressible in L, the complement of A is expressible in L, then</li>
</ul>


<p>the set T of Goedel numbers of the true sentences of L is not expressible in L.</p>

<p>(Where A* is the set of all n with d(n) in A and d the <span class="createlink">diagonal function</span>).</p>

<p><span class="createlink">toggle id&#61;tarski text&#61;&#34;Proof&#34;</span>
<span class="createlink">toggleable id=tarski text="""</p>

<blockquote><p>Assume hypotheses. If the set T were expressible in L, also the complement of T would be expressible in L and thus a [[Goedel sentence</span> for the complement of T would exist (<span class="createlink">diagonal lemma</span>). But trivially, this Goedel sentence cannot exist (it would be true iff it were not true).
"""]]</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, consider PA. For any set Arithmetic set A (Arithmetic = expressible in PA), A* and the complement of A are also Arithmetic. Tarski's Theorem tells us that the set T of Goedel numbers of true arithmetic sentences is not Arithmetic.</p>

<p>However, the set P of Goedel numbers of provable arithmetic sentences (provable in PA) is Arithmetic.</p>

<p>We conclude that T and P don't coincide. Assuming consistency of PA, there must be a true arithmetic sentence which is not provable in PA. This sentence is also not disprovable (again, by the consistency assumption), so PA is incomplete.</p>
