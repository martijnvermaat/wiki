We have a machine 'client' behind a NAT firewall and a machine 'server' to which we can directly connect. We want to connect from 'server' to 'basement'.

For this purpose, we created the user 'natuser' on 'server' (but of course we could do with any existing user).

On 'client':

    $ ssh -R 2022:localhost:22 natuser@server 'while :; do sleep 86400; done'

On 'server':

    $ ssh -p 2022 localhost
