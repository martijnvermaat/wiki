# Repository migrating

Dumping a repository including all revisions:

    svnadmin dump /path/to/repository > repository.dump

Load a dumpfile into a repository:

    svnadmin load /path/to/repository < repository.dump

Filtering a dumpfile can be done with svndumpfilter. For example, to keep only everything inside the 'wiki' directory:

    svndumpfilter include wiki --drop-empty-revs --renumber-revs < repository.dump > wiki.dump

We can edit this dump file to get rid of the 'wiki' parent directory. To just rename 'wiki' to 'trunk':

    Node-path: wiki*           ->  Node-path: trunk*
    Node-copyfrom-path: wiki*  ->  Node-copyfrom-path: trunk*

Potential issue is that nodes copied from outside the 'wiki' directory don't have their content in the dump file, rendering the dump useless. Try [svndumpfilter2](http://www.tartarus.org/~simon-anonsvn/viewcvs.cgi/svn-tools/svndumpfilter2?view=markup).

We could also just drop the 'wiki' prefix from all paths. Rename Node-path and Node-copyfrom-path values appropriately as like above, and remove the initial creation of the 'wiki' directory. The entry in the dumpfile will look like this:

    Node-path: wiki
    Node-action: add
    Node-kind: dir
    Content-length: 0

# Automated backups

Make daily, weekly and monthly backups on the repository server with [an svnadmin dump script](http://svn.vermaat.name/conf/home/dreamhost-vermaatsvn/bin/svn-backup).

On other hosts, [use rsync](http://svn.vermaat.name/conf/home/priscilla/bin/copy-svn-backup) to sync an offline backup with the latest daily backup on the repository server.
