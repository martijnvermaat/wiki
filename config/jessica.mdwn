# System configuration

## Partitioning

One 40 GB harddisk on /dev/hda:

    /dev/hda1 mounted as / (4.6 GB)
    /dev/hda2 swap (1.2 GB)
    /dev/hda3 mounted as /home (rest of 40 GB)

# Backups

Backups should be made automatically and be reasonably up-to-date. Furthermore, some older snapshots should be available. Backups must not be stored on the primary hard drive. Video files and music do not need to be in the backup (music is stored on the USB disk anyway).

This is achieved by synchronizing a copy of the data on the external USB disk every day. At the beginning of each month, a new copy is started. This way we can go back in time by months and always have a current copy of our data. The data consists of /etc and /home/rosanne with a blacklist.

This script is run by root every morning: [sync-backup](http://svn.vermaat.name/conf/home/jessica/bin/sync-backup)

The blacklist file in /home/rosanne/.backup-filter looks something like this:

    /music
    /.aMule
    /.thumbnails
    /.beagle
    .svn
    *Cache
    *cache
    *.wav
    *.mp3
    *.ogg
    *.avi
    *.mpeg
    *.mpg
    *.wmv
    *.asf
    *.wma
    *.m4v

This makes for backup snapshots of around 400MB.
