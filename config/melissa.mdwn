## Partitioning

One 160 GB harddisk on /dev/hda:

    /dev/hda1 mounted as /boot (220 MB)
    /dev/hda2 LVM volume group (rest of 160 GB)

The LVM volume group contains LVM volumes:

    /dev/mapper/lvm--group-lvm--root    mounted as / (8 GB)
    /dev/mapper/lvm--group-lvm--home    mounted as /home (116 GB)

## Sound

Install 'aumix' to adjust the volume of the sound chip.


# User configuration

## Shared data

The /vermaat partition is shared by adding all users to the 'vermaat'
group. We make sure everything in /vermaat is owned by 'vermaat' and
readable and writable for all group members.

[This](http://svn.vermaat.name/conf/home/melissa/bin/shared-permissions) script is executed by root every few hours.

The shared F-Spot database and photos are also stored on this partition
and used as described on [[f-spot]].
