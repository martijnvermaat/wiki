Server PC in [[sommelsdijk]] with Debian Etch.

This machine used to serve my Subversion repositories over HTTP,
but is now just a backup server for [[melissa]] and temorarily
connects the network to the internet with the USB modem since the
ethernet modem has died.

As of June 6 2007, the following software has been removed: Apache 2,
Subversion, Sun J2SDK 1.4/1.5, MoinMoin, PHP4, MySQL, vsftpd, Samba.
