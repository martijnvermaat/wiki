Playing streams from the [3voor12 website](http://3voor12.vpro.nl/) is not always easy.

[Some tips](http://bler.webschuur.com/3voor12_real_streams_rippen_en_luisteren) (seem to apply to the old 3voor12 website)

This worked for me today (2007-08-21): Find the number identifying the stream (e.g. 36252494 for [Dinosaur Jr at Lowlands 2007](http://3voor12.vpro.nl/3voor12/festivals/news/full.jsp?portal=2534202&event=35167015&news=36257765&type=-1)). The Media URL for the Dinosaur Jr stream would be

    http://cgi.omroep.nl/cgi-bin/streams?/vpro/36252494/windowsmedia.asf?end=1:9:51&title=Dinosaur JR live op Lowlands 2007&author=Dinosaur Jr

Try replacing the stream number with another one and leave out the title and author arguments (the end argument probably hints your player on the length of the stream, but you most likely don't know its value at this time).

Just launch totem or mplayer with the URL you constructed, or dump the stream with 'mplayer -dumpstream'.
